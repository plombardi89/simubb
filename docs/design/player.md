# Players

Teams and composed of players and games are played by players. The player is the most fundamental unit in the game. Player's are composed of biographical information (e.g. name, birthdate, birthplace, handedness), ratings (e.g. power, discipline, command) 

# Player Biography

A player biography provides mostly meaningless background information about a player's person. It exists to add a little bit of detail to the game world and make it seem more realistic. Information that falls under this category:

- Birth date  (age computed from this)
- Birthplace
- Handedness (Bats/Throws) (Left, Right, Ambidextrous)
- Height     
- Weight

# Player Ratings

Players have core ratings that control how they perform in game situations. Internally ratings run from 1 to 255. However, owner's are are not shown these numbers and instead see a letter scale of A (best) through G (worst). 

## Pitching Ratings

- Velocity **VE** - How hard a pitcher throws. (K/9+++, HR/9+)
- Movement **MV** - How much movement pitches have. (H/9--, HR/9--, K/9+)
- Control **CO** - How good a pitcher is at hitting the strikezone (BB/9---, K/9+)
- Command **CM** - How good a pitcher can hit targets in the strikezone. This is very important because great velocity and movement do not matter if a pitcher pipe's balls down the heart of the plate. This is a meta-rating that either helps or hurts a pitcher. 

## Batting Ratings

## Defensive Ratings

## Miscellaneous Ratings

# Abilities

Abilities are things players do specially. Abilities are measured on a five point scale (3 is neutral). I want to model this similar to the MLB Power Pro's game (http://www.mlbppworld.com/wiki/index.php?title=Category:Abilities).
